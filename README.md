# Turn-Based Chess-Like Game with WebSocket Communication

## Overview
This project is a turn-based chess-like game designed for real-time play using WebSocket communication. Players control teams of characters on a 5x5 grid, aiming to capture their opponent's pieces. The game supports two players with distinct movement rules for different character types and updates the game state in real-time.

## Components

### 1. Server
- **Language**: Node.js
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement core game logic.
  - Set up and manage the WebSocket server.
  - Process game moves and maintain the game state.
  - Broadcast game state updates to clients.

### 2. WebSocket Layer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle real-time communication between the server and clients.
  - Manage events for game initialization, moves, state updates, and notifications.

### 3. Web Client
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Display the game board and controls.
  - Implement WebSocket communication with the server.
  - Render game state and provide interactive controls for players.
